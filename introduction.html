        <h2>What is the Tragedy of the Commons?</h2>
        <p>
            The <strong>Tragedy of the Commons</strong> is a concept first introduced by ecologist <strong>Garrett Hardin</strong> in 1968. 
            It describes how individuals, acting in their own self-interest, can deplete shared resources, 
            leading to negative consequences for everyone.
        </p>

        <p>
            Imagine a beautiful **village garden** that belongs to everyone. Initially, it thrives as a 
            shared resource. But as villagers take more than their fair share, the garden begins to suffer, 
            becoming barren and unusable. This simple story illustrates a bigger issue that affects 
            **our environment, economy, and society** today.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Concepts:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>When a resource is shared by many but owned by none, conservation is often neglected.</li>
            <li>Short-term individual gain can lead to long-term collective loss.</li>
            <li>Regulation and communal responsibility are needed to prevent resource depletion.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Understanding this concept is crucial for addressing global challenges like **climate change, pollution, 
            overfishing, and deforestation**. Letâ€™s explore how this affects our world and what we can do about it!

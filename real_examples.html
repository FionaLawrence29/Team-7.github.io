        <h2>How the Tragedy of the Commons Affects the World</h2>
        <p>
            The **Tragedy of the Commons** is not just a theory‚Äîit impacts real-world resources every day. Here are some key examples:
        </p>

        <h3>1. Overfishing in the Oceans üåä</h3>
        <p>
            The world's oceans are a shared resource, but excessive fishing has led to the depletion of fish populations.
            Without regulation, fish stocks decline, harming both marine life and the livelihoods of fishing communities.
            **Solution:** Governments enforce fishing quotas and protected marine zones to promote sustainability.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Deforestation of the Amazon Rainforest üå≥</h3>
        <p>
            The Amazon is called the "lungs of the Earth," yet large-scale deforestation continues for agriculture and logging.
            With no single owner, companies prioritize profit over conservation, leading to biodiversity loss and climate change.
            **Solution:** Reforestation programs and international agreements aim to protect the forest.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Air Pollution & Global Warming üåç</h3>
        <p>
            Factories, cars, and industries emit pollutants into the air, affecting everyone.
            Since air is a shared resource, individual polluters may not feel responsible for the damage they cause.
            **Solution:** Governments enforce emission regulations and promote renewable energy.
        </p>
